            <h3>Dry Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Drycleaning is very similar to regular home laundering, but a liquid solvent is used to clean your clothes instead of water and detergent.</p>

            <h3>Wash & Laundry</h3>
            <p>Laundry can be frustrating, even for a laundry enthusiast. It's time-consuming, unceasing and there is so very much that can go wrong. For many of us, itâ€™s one of those chores we learned to do from our parents, a dormmate, a significant other or whoever else, and then we stop asking questions.</p>

            <h3>Curtain Laundry</h3>
            <p>Curtains can finish a room, but they are also dust and dirt magnets. Sometimes knowing how to wash curtains can be a mystery, especially if they are delicate. Fortunately, you can usually clean drapes and curtains by machine, hand, or steam clean them two to four times a year to keep the dust, dander, and stains under control.</p>

            <h3>Suits Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Instead of water, a chemical solvent is used to clean and sanitize your suit. Dry-cleaning is the best option if you want to sanitize a men's suit. However, remember that chemicals are employed, that can damage the fabric of a tailored-suit in the long run.</p>
